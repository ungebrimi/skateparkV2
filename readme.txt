This project is built with VITE as a build tool and compiler

https://vitejs.dev/

When opening up the project in VS-Code open terminal and run "yarn dev" 
this will start a development server on localhost:3000

it's setup with a path to public so when importing files for images or other things look at the html how I imported

When you want to deploy the app run "yarn build", this will compile you code into the dist folder.
The dist folder is what you will upload to wherever you want to upload your site.
Note that after build the pages folder will not be in it. 
this you have to copy and paste into the dist folder yourself before uploading.

I took the time to comment all of my code in main.js. I'm sorry it's spagetthi code
but I did not want to use classes if you were not familiar with them.
Atleast I think you will get what everything does and I left some examples commented out like how to add to GUI
and the fog is commented out just uncomment to add it, parameters are written above 
also if good source for documentation on my code is at threejs docs, if you are courious about things.
but feel free to ask.

That's it I think. Have fun and contact me if anything.
